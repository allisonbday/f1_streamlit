I love Formula 1 and wanted to create a simple web app that would allow me to see the results of different funny statistics. I have used the [FastF1 package](https://docs.fastf1.dev/) to get the data. A lot of these scenarios are inspired by the [F1 subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/) and different youtube channels and will always link to the original post.
